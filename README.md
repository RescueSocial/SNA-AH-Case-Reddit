## <b>Reddit - Social Network Analysis on Amber Heard's Case Example from Data Analysts, Researchers, and Scientists.</b>
- It's important to look at Reddit in the context of cross-platform operations and comparing - e.g., ages of accounts during peaks, statistical differences or similarities, natural language processing, timelines, and amplifications.
- 4 Reddit Reports for per year for 2018-2021 and a Users Report.
- Data from Reddit: 164,530 Contributions, 15,896 Submissions, 71,319 Accounts, Links

<b><i>Note from Researchers: 
  <br>These reports are a part of Case Study: “Reddit Social Network Analysis Against Influence Operation” by analyzing accounts posting/commenting against a victim of a Social Bot Disinformation/Influence Operation.</b></i>
<br>We have four main datasets scraped from Reddit
<br>1. A dataset with submissions & comments data (2020).
<br>2. Users Data (from 2006 to 2020).
<br>3. A merged dataset (submissions & comments data, users data).
<br>4. Daily creation data (# of accounts created per day from 2006 to 2020).
<br><i>The data Timezone is Epoch/UTC.</i>

<i>Notes:</i> Reddit began to achieve a notable level of popularity in mid-2010, and it has expanded its reach since. It had become “really popular” in early 2013. Reddit was launched in June 2005. 
<br>The effect of 2020 is obvious, but we can see a small effect from 2021 as the data collected till May of this 2021.
<br><i>Reddit does not remove contributions and submissions from banned accounts.</i>
