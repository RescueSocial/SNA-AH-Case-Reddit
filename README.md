Notes: -
Reddit began to achieve a notable level of popularity in mid-2010, and it has expanded its reach since. It had become “really popular” in early 2013.
Reddit was launched in June 2005
The effect of 2020 is obvious, but we can see a small effect from 2021 as the data collected till May of this 2021.

Newly created accounts in 2018, 2019, 2020,2021
As the data collected from 2018 to 2021, the most suspicious accounts are the new ones which are created between 2018 and 2021.
