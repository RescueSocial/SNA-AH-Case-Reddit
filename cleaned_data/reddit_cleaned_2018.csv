It’s pretty ironic to me that people are outraged over Johnny Depp playing Grindelwald, when I honestly think that if any actor in a 2018 WB blockbuster deserves outrage, it’s Amber Heard.

>I’m going to go ahead and say that I’m convinced at this point that she has been lying about being abused by Johnny Depp. I know that not believing the accuser often comes across as a bad thing to do, but there is evidence to suggest that she has been trying to frame Depp. Not only did the police apparently find zero evidence to suggest that Depp assaulted her, but the supposed video that Heard presented to “prove” that she was assaulted didn’t even show him doing anything of the sort. I’ve watched the video several times, and while there’s no denying that Depp is angry in it, none of it looks like it’s directed towards Heard. At no point in the video is he shown being physically or verbally abusive to her, nor does she seem like she’s scared of him in the slightest. This would of course explain why Heard hasn’t presented that “evidence” to court.

>Furthermore, Heard demanded money from Depp from this whole ordeal. I know that people respond to abuse differently, but if she is truly someone who wanted out of an abusive relationship because she feared for her life, why exactly was her first instinct to try and get a piece of Johnny Depp’s money?

>One day, as I sat in our driveway in Long Island playing with blocks and buckets, my curiosity got the best of me. Grace was sitting up, babbling and smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina. She didn’t resist and when I saw what was inside I shrieked. 

>...“kiss her on the lips for five seconds” by offering gifts of sweets or coins. “Basically, anything a sexual predator might do to woo a small suburban girl, I was trying,”

.

>Plus, isn’t Amber Heard a fan of Ayn Rand, in addition to being a gun owner? Those don’t seem like particularly left-leaning qualities

What I´m saying is if Matt Damon was accused of and did those things she is. There would be massive backlash if he was cast in a movie. Amber Heard not a problem for actresses and social media that she is cast.

>""London Fields” made headlines in 2015 when it was pulled from the Toronto International Film Festival after Cullen filed a lawsuit against his producers for taking away final cut privileges behind his back and failing to pay him. The following year, Heard filed for divorce from Johnny Depp following domestic abuse allegations. Depp appears in a cameo role in “London Fields.” The film’s producers then sued Heard for $10 million, accusing her of not completing the film they agreed to make, only for Heard to countersue them in 2017 for allegedly hiring a body double to make it seem like the actress had more nudity scenes than her contract required.

>Despite all of these legal troubles, “London Fields” will open in theaters in August with a reedited cut. - [Indiewire](http://www.indiewire.com/2018/06/london-fields-trailer-amber-heard-seductress-1201971503/)",t1_e078arj,r/movies,Johnny_W94,2018-06-06 10:29:24,Positive,Neutral,14.0,comment,comment,133,london_fields_trailer_amber_heard_billy_bob,7,['http://www.indiewire.com'],1

Anyways: YES, she does get saved multiple times. But the damsel in distress cliché, imo, is when a woman is just that. An object to be saved. So, by definition, EVERY Lois Lane incarnations are just that?.... Except no. Because Lois Lane actually contributes to something and isn't an object to be saved (in most comics, i think)..... And she literally saves Clark MULTIPLE times in BvS and she even saves him in MoS. She frees him him from the Kryptonian ship, she stops him from being killed by Batman and she saves him from drowning. 

> She's poorly written, just like every other female character in Snyder's movies. And Faora is not an example of good female character.

1: Why is she poorly written?

2: Why are women in Snyder's films so poorly written?

3: Why is Faora not a good female character? Even if she doesn't have a lot of screen-time, she's powerful, she has drive and doesn't cower to anyone.

Nothing really comes to mind though. There are definitely instances in the past that I can think of where an actor is considered shitty, and then they'll nail a major role from a good director and are no longer considered a shitty actor and start getting more parts (run on sentences are a helluva drug). Like take Travolta for instance, I'm not saying he's a great actor but up until he did Pulp Fiction he was definitely not considered a great actor and was struggling for good parts for years in the early 90's after his critically acclaimed role in look who's talking. Joking. Pulp Fiction revigorated his career and I thought he had some great roles after that up until around 2000 when he starred in Battlefield Earth (he's great in Michael, Get Shorty, Face/Off was fun as was Broken Arrow, etc.). The McConaissance is a more recent revelation that a person can act that was previously thought of as sub par/average. Even actors like Halle Berry, whose biggest role before Monsters Ball was maybe BAPS, could be thrown in that category. She definitely had some duds after MB, but she also turned in some good performances that boosted her stock so to speak. Ha I guess I sort of answered your question, but my point is usually an actor in that instance will usually get more chances to shine after a solid performance under a good director so it's hard just to point out a single time in an actors career where this happened and they didn't do anything else meaningful afterwards.

""Many who agree with Donald Trump on immigration understand that the whole system needs to be reformed, so that those who want to come to the United States for a better life aren't trapped in low-pay, dead-end jobs.""

This^

We need to make it easier to be legal. When people come here illegally, they are vulnerable to being exploited. And uncontrolled illegal immigration hurts most the immigrants who have already settled here, the ones who have arrived from the same countries. It lowers their wages.

And I saw the ""solution"" that the Democrats proposed to fix the immigration system. Big surprise, from what I saw it only expanded temporary work visas, not anything that would allow for permanent residence and open the door to citizenship like a greencard does. 

And temporary visas are often overstayed, leaving the person illegal. I can imagine how a greedy employer might pressure an employee to overstay their temporary work visa and not renew it, threatening their job security or refusing to cooperate with necessary paperwork and then taking advantage of them once they lose their legal status. Maybe that never happens, idk, but I think it potentially could.

But your whole argument is that it should be made easier. I don't think it should be. It should be harder.

And we've always had *waves* of immigration in the past. Let some in, then cut it off for a few decades. It forces the people who just came in to adapt to American culture, American values, the English language, the American way of live, and feel more connected to the United States than their former country. Then when they have kids, those kids are being raised as *Americans* from the get go, not [insert nationality here]'s who just happen to be living in America. You bring in a group, make them all completely assimilate and become American, wait a bit longer, then bring in some more. Uninterrupted waves of immigration, legal or illegal, allows communities of people who still think think of themselves as Mexican (or Irish or Chinese or whatever) to thrive and not adapt since they're constantly getting new people who keep the ""we're not American, we're just living off of you"" attitude alive.

Defamation lawsuits are almost impossible to prove, no? That's why tabloids can get away with making things up and celebs don't sue because they can't win.

Maybe Amber Heard is nuts but Johnny Depp also doesn't seem like a sane dude.

Here's what I googled [source](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/amber-heard-drops-defamation-lawsuit-against-johnny-depp-s-friend-and-comedian-doug-stanhope-a7230231.html):

>“Doug is happy that Amber is dropping the case against him. It looks like Amber and Johnny have resolved things. He is pleased both parties are moving forward,” Gingras said.

>“He is sorry there was a falling out, but is happy that everyone is taking the high road and moving on”.

It seems like everyone there is a bit nuts. But that still doesn't make Heard a liar. It seems like Depp and Heard settled and then she decided to give it a rest. Maybe a part of settlement was that she drops lawsuit against Stanhope.

>Heard and Depp reached an out of court $7 million settlement in August, with Heard choosing to donate the full sum of the settlement to two charities. 

>The settlement follows one of the most acrimonious high-profile separations in recent history which saw Heard accuse Depp of physical and emotional abuse and Depp strongly deny those allegations.

>After the agreement was reached, Heard and Depp released a joint statement, saying: “Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.”

I don't see how anything here makes her a liar. ",t1_e2ul1e6,r/movies,shy247er,2018-07-22 20:50:33,Positive,Neutral,6.0,comment,comment,269,just_a_friendly_reminder_that_domestic_abuse_is,8,['https://www.independent.co.uk'],1

The only way he could have done it was in this lawsuit because of the divorce NDA. I personally hope he sues a lot of these scum bags that keep accusing him of all this stuff, and the whole lurid story of Scamber's abuse of Johnny comes out.

His bodyguards said that she was constantly attacking him physically, and they had to ""peel her off of him"" several times. I personally still want to know what the housekeeper found that was so bad that it was going to be introduced in evidence had the divorce gone to trial.

Let's see how she deals with being accused of abuse, since she IS an abuser. I know abusive men. I was married to one, and they don't just start abusing women. Every woman he was ever with said my husband abused them. None of Johnny's exes will say that about him, just the opposite, yet Amber's friends say she ""goes trailer park"" when she gets mad, and we all know what that means. She's the one who was charged with domestic abuse, not him.

In that scenario you're still wrong, as they would both be in the wrong and are both abusers and victims. Your making this a one sided scenario where she's perfectly within reason to beat him because he may or may not have beaten her in the past.

But humans are more complicated..  
I know a couple personally that are  fuckin toxic for each other- Which I told both in a more polite way. They increase each others bad sides and escalate as I have been told.  
And both told me that they both sometimes initiate it, or, and I quote ""Well I slapped him in his face twice"".  
But that this happens still doesn't negate the answer (everything besides leaving is a bad answer). 
it just shows that shit is sometimes more complex, sometimes its not complex at all(like in the parents of a friend wherr the violence was unquestionably unilateral and escalated really fast. 
I had to pull away from those two I knew bc they separated, went together, one left or the other and like this is going for years and having to watch two people eho were once lovable become both horrid egotistical abusive assholes is painful and so frustrating..

Johnny is more self-destructive, and he's admitted to that. He refuses to use the word ""alcoholic,"" although he clearly is, but that doesn't make him a bad person or a wife beater. I can see him being distrustful and controlling, though, and both of them are manipulative. 

What really strikes a chord about Amber is her seemingly uncontrollable impulsivity and vengefulness. She could have just left things alone and gotten the same settlement, maybe even more (without having to give it all away) and not had to deal with all the bad publicity on both sides. Even now, her stans won't let it go, and keep calling Johnny names and trying to ruin him. No wonder he's finally fighting back after almost two years of her constant attacks through other people.

""Contrary to the physical attractiveness stereotype, attractive and unattractive Ss did not differ in their personality styles.""

Despite the whole issue of physical attractiveness being subjective to begin with, ""ugly"" people can be spoiled and obnoxious.  ""Attractive"" people can have self-esteem issues and end up being socially awkward.   

Also, wouldn't you suspect that since you presume attractive people would be more likely to be in social situations that they would end up refining and developing complex social interaction skills as a result?  Otherwise your laughable portrait of ""really hot girls"" is just some girl, straight out of a sexual exploitation film, standing around eating a cherry seductively, nodding her head, not knowing what's going on?

The majority of attractive people are not airheads and socially inept.  And, it's definitely not the case that the majority of unattractive people are socially adept and charismatic.",t1_e3y23df,r/GirlsMirin,albybum,2018-08-10 13:15:39,Positive,Neutral,11.0,comment,comment,182,amber_heard_mirin_jason_momoa,5,['https://www.tandfonline.com'],1

At this point, it really doesn't matter who got published first. Marvel beat DC to the punch a long time ago, and publish dates be damned, Black Panther still exists, and thus, as a competent filmmaker, you have to tweak your ideas to be original. That said, Black Panther is also a CGI clusterfuck. The effects look cheap and the slow motion is so unnecessary. They ruined some pretty good choreography with all of that.

So I went to Wikipedia & looked at her filmography.  She has been:

* Maria in *Friday Night Lights* (the movie not the show), her first big role when she was around 18. Maria? I guess the girlfriend or sister of one of the football players?

* Angie in *Pineapple Express*. Angie?  I guess the girlfriend (or sister) of one of the male leads?

* 406 in *Zombieland*. Okay at least I remember 406; she was Columbus's hot AF neighbor before the zombie outbreak, who then turned zombie and Columbus had to club her head with the lid of his toilet. So, around 2 minutes on screen.

* Miss San Antonio in *Machete Kills*. Some kind of beauty queen

* Zoe in *Magic Mike XXL*. One of the male stripper's girlfriend (or sister? I forget)

* Mera in *Justice League* and also the forthcoming *Aquaman*. Mera is Aquaman's wife in Atlantis, dontcha know.

Now granted I'm skipping over a bunch of little indie movies she's done, but I figure my tastes as a moviegoer are fairly average. As in I haven't seen it, the average moviegoer hasn't either.

Because when I was younger, we were the fucking boondocks of entertainment, man.  Any movie coming from Hollywood was delayed by 2-3 fucking months, if it came at all because the reels that get sent to us are the same reels they send over tho US theaters. And by the time our turn came, the reels would all be fucked up and shit already so you see scratches during the filming even if it's just the first day. And we're already talking about Metro Manila theaters here. Provincial theaters had to wait another couple of months depending on when the reels get finished from other provinces. By then the films were practically garbage quality. 

We did not get simultaneous screenings and even advanced screenings until the late 90s with the advent of VCD/DVD piracy and the uptake in international sales that made the US realize how much money is to be made if people got to watch the movie at the peak of its hype. 

And now we have the leads of a big name movie ONE WEEK ahead of the US?! 

Unbelievable.

t1_eaq2yt5,/r/Vent/comments/a1htgc/amber_heardjohnny_depp/eaq2yt5/,"Amber was arrested for domestic violence against her ex but she did not beat the shit out of her. It was well documented that they were also both involved in the altercation. Not that it makes it better but I think that is good to have your facts straight if you feel so passionate about the subject. 

&#x200B;

It is awful that Johnny Depp did not receive more of a backlash because Amber Heard had video proof of his abuse and violent personality. Just because he wasn't this way with other partners does not mean he didn't do it to her. There is no proof she was or wasn't violent against him either, but saying she was abused is not saying he didn't receive the same thing. 

&#x200B;

The thing is, she had proof of the abuse and he didn't. Compared to all the women in Hollywood that have come out with their stories of abuse, Amber was attacked, mistreated, judged, and not believed (even though she had videos, witnesses, and medical records), and mostly it was because no one wanted to believe that an actor that had been part of so many iconic and mostly childhood films was the abuser in the situation. 

&#x200B;

There are many colors to abusive relationships, it is unfair to say that because he is Johnny Depp, she could by no means have been put through things. They could have both very well been put through shit by the other, but it was the way people reacted to her that felt very biased towards Depp. ",t3_a1htgc,r/Vent,-banned-,2018-11-29 16:28:05,Positive,Neutral,-1.0,submission,comment,261,amber_heardjohnny_depp,3,[],0

It’s unfair to think that he did not also suffer abuse from her or that we cannot question her or that her history of abuse is not held against her art as his is. I’ve heard people felt people were biased towards Depp, but my experience is the opposite. She had evidence  and he also says he has pictures and witnesses of her violence to him. It’s  an unhealthy relationship between two people who are much victims as abusers, not the one sided wife beater story that’s written about. The more people dismiss Depps allegations of abuse, the more it looks like few care about male domestic abuse. 

From what I understand, Ambers ex was defending herself from Amber. But maybe I was wrong and it was just a brawl between them. ",t1_eaq2yt5,r/Vent,Netteka,2018-11-29 20:09:57,Negative,Neutral,1.0,comment,comment,147,amber_heardjohnny_depp,3,[],0

Okay, but again, the author is not implying that the salary is low.   
  
She is simply saying that the number falls in the range of around 1-4 million dollars, as opposed to a ""low-six-figure-salary"" of 100k-400k, or a ""high-seven-figure-salary"" of 6-9 million.

>*""I don't know why I am surprised, but she is such a well-read person,"" says Aquaman director James Wan. ""In between takes, every time I saw her she would have just finished a big thick book and was on to a new thick book.""* ***With Heard, perhaps it's too easy to judge the book by its cover.***

Writer couldn't help it. 

>*Momoa made sure to assert his dominance off-camera, albeit with a prank. ""She stepped away, and I ripped out the last 10 pages of her 800-page book, like the last chapter,"" he says.*
 
*>:(*

>*The book in question was Yuval Noah Harari's Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow*

Harari's a pretty good writer btw. He's got some out-there ideas about the post-human condition but all of that can be a really good companion piece to draw ideas from for Atlanteans.

>*Though she spends much of her activist time outside of Hollywood, she says the industry, too, needs plenty of fixing. ""Hollywood is the slowest to change. It's ironically held up as some bastion of progressive ideals, and yet the reality is the exact opposite,"" she says. ""It's deeply risk-averse and reliant on maintaining the status quo.""*

t1_ebbd4x6,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/a2rqlb/oh_boy_but_i_have_to_say_this_i_dont_believe_for/ebbd4x6/,"I completely agree with you. I couldn't care less how a person treats other people. An abuser can treat his or her victim horribly while also being kind and sweet to other people. Also many abusers have no history of domestic violence. When it comes to a he said she said scenario, I believe women, I believe victims. However, I've never been a Depp fan but after doing some digging I'm slightly confused regarding this case. 

According to court documents, police who attended the scene after the alleged incident in May 2016, testify that she had no injuries and no signs of abuse was witnessed. Bodyguards heard Amber yelling and ran to help her. When they entered the room, they saw her on the phone yelling don't hit me Johnny when he was on the other side of the room to her looking confused. There are also multiple witnesses that saw her without a bruise with little to no make up on days following the incident. He has multiple other witnesses on his side to collaborate his story that he didn't actively abuse or hit her. 

He is also suing the UK Sun newspaper and has other evidence yet to be released . 

There is also evidence that one of her witnesses who gave a statement saying they saw her on a particular day and witnessed a bruise was actually half way across the country filming a tv show that very day. 

Now I'm not saying I know for sure she is lying. I'm just saying this is all very odd and I'm not comfortable labelling him an abuser. I guess you can say all these witneses are lying for him but again the only evidence a witness is lying is the witness on her side not his. I might agree with this line of thinking if he had police and media backing but every major newspaper has released opinion pieces calling for his removal from Hollywood's elite. The media hates him. Hollywood establishment media hate him. Disney has fired him. WB made sure he didn't take part in the marketing of their last major film with him in it.

 I mean if he's supposedly powerful enough to make the LAPD lie for him and hoodwink the justice system into dropping his charges with prejudice you would think he would have major powerful media backing. 
No way is the media more moral than the police. The media is far more corrupt.  I just find this whole thing odd.  ",t1_eb0oz7h,r/unpopularopinion,SuperordinateRevere,2018-12-07 21:25:10,Negative,Neutral,5.0,comment,comment,418,oh_boy_but_i_have_to_say_this_i_dont_believe_for,12,[],0
t1_ebbekqj,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/a2rqlb/oh_boy_but_i_have_to_say_this_i_dont_believe_for/ebbekqj/,"Jk Rowling is a producer. She did meet him and she did have the power to fire him. 

Rowling's first husband was physically abusive. Her first charity helped domestic violence victims two decades ago, at a time when society didn't prioritise this issue. Her books have literally been about surviving abuse and the consequences of abuse. 

In her statement she talks about how she considered recasting him initially but after looking into the ""circumstances"" of the allegations she and the other producers chose to keep him on and she was genuinely ""happy"" he was a part of the franchise. Odd words to use if you think this person is guilty of a crime you were once the victim of (btw she suffered deep depression and mental illness after she escaped from him. She knows the consequences of abuse). SHE definitely thinks he is innocent. In one of the only interviews he was allowed to make he openly says as much. 

https://ew.com/movies/2018/10/11/johnny-depp-grindelwald-interview/amp/

Maybe you shouldn't make a judgement on someones innocence because a producer trusts this person however, considering this particular producer's history I don't blame people who do trust her.

More generally, abusers have a lot of incentives to be charming to people they are not abusing. Among other things, doing so creates a cloud of people to say ""He isn't like that."" I believe that Depp was charming and nice when interacting with JK. I don't think that is evidence that he isn't abusive in private.

As in she saw the evidence and was satisfied. This case seems quite complicated and I also disagree that we know more than her or was given as much information as her. Again there is a court case he is currently conducting (suing a newspaper for calling him an abuser) where more evidence gets released as the case goes on (in his favour) so there is much we still don't know. Again im not saying this is evidence he is innocent.

And he does have rather compelling evidence on his side. Evidence I outlined in another comment from court documents.

Evidence we didn't know about 2 years ago is being released now with promise of more to come. It is very possible she knew about said evidence before the public. 2 years ago most of the so called evidence was from TMZ and other tabloids. The evidence recently released was actually from court documents. It's incredibly arrogant to believe the public has enough evidence to judge a case when ppl know neither heard nor depp with no reliance that the evidence is valid when it was from tabloid sources. 

Employers including movie studios and movie productions conduct their own investigations where they examine all evidence not released to the public to determine if they should keep the employee who is being accused of a crime or not (which is why Kevin Spacey and other ppl were fired from productions before court cases released verdicts).
JKR and most of the FB crew have said they looked at the evidence. It is far more possible their evidence wasn't from tabloid sources and is evidence admitted in court cases precisely as well as this current court case, and only now being released to the public as they were not released by tabloids before.

This seems incredibly implausible to me. As far as I know, no evidence has been admitted in any court case. If it had, it would be public.

What likely does exist is evidence that Depp and his legal team believe would allow them to win their case. The source of that evidence may not be whatever internal investigation was done. But I don't think JKR is particularly likely to have access to that evidence.

t1_ebgo7ze,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/a4n9u2/other_amber_heard_has_said_she_would_love_to_team/ebgo7ze/,"Joker I agree is overused. Superman being in other forms of media doesn't mean he shouldn't spearhead the DCEU. Him WW and Batman should always lead the charge in the same way Cap, Iron Man and Thor do. The problem I find with your argument is you are acting like this is just some regular character. This is Superman, him and Batman are known by every joe, and more big screen superman is never a bad thing from a marketing perspective. Do you really think there is Superman fatigue? After 80 years,  the character has barely changed. Compare that to Batman who has drastically changed from his original goofy nature. Supes is a hero that transcends all of them, and it is completely fucking stupid for WB not to use him in a DCEU struggling to stay *afloat* (im not sorry) going forward. I have no problem with other B list characters. Birds of Prey is great, Shazam is great, but some characters are not known and therefore difficult to make shine. The only female comic back characters people knew before the movies exploded were likely Wonder Woman, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy. What that says about old comic books is up for debate, but regardless, this is a business, and I do not see WB marketing strategy here. Ben affleck rumoured to quit Batman, internet explodes in praise of him. Cavill rumoured to be out, twitter causes a shitstorm so ridiculous that within minutes people start claiming Michael B jordan as the next Superman. And my god is the market there, people want MoS 2.",t1_ebggwfy,r/DC_Cinematic,kirbydudez64,2018-12-09 23:44:35,Positive,Neutral,0.0,comment,comment,265,DC_Cinematic,2,[],0

t1_ebgot5p,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/a4n9u2/other_amber_heard_has_said_she_would_love_to_team/ebgot5p/,"In my headcanon, Blackest Night is one of several potential endgames for a DCEU

Flashpoint would be great, but I'm fine if we don't get it. If we got in in say a Flash 2 then you have to establish Eobard Thawne in the first. And then where do you go in the third? It just seems hard to top that, and whatever story was in Flash1 is stopped dead and restarted at the end of Flashpoint. Plus I don't want Thawne first; I'd rather go Rogues-Grodd-Thawne, build him up and hint to him before the big reveal that he has been manipulating events throughout time. It makes way more of an impact that way when it's not just the childhood we don't see, it opens up new questions about the previous movies that makes us look back and question everything, that's what makes it so great. Also cos I want Flash2 to introduce Wally to eventually spin him off into a Teen Titans/Young Justice movie......

Oh and at this point i'd be fine with recasting Ezra; he made zero effort in JL (as evidenced by his great acting in Crimes of Grindlewald reminding how he put none of that skill into JL), and he's gonna be busy with that for a while so just get someone else in, aaaaaaand no-ones gonna miss him cos no-one liked him in the first place. Right now my current choice for a recast would be Lucas Till, though I'd be fine if it wasn't him.

t1_ebj2pw0,/r/gentlemanboners/comments/a4xibc/amber_heard/ebj2pw0/,"It's more complicated than people like to make it appear. 

There have been photos and videos leaked that, while they do not prove any physical abuse on Depp's part, do show her bruised and show Depp being _verbally_ aggressive towards her (separate incidents I should add, no suggestion that the video led to the photos). However former partners of Depp, including Winona Ryder, came out in support of him and said he was never in any way abusive during their relationships.

Their lawyers also issued a joint statement after the divorce was finalized that stated ""Neither party has made false accusations **for financial gain**. There was never any **intent of** physical or emotional harm” (my highlighting).  This seems to suggest both sides agree that she wasn't gold-digging and that he was never intentionally abusive, although it's almost deliberately vague and could probably be read differently by various people (my personal opinion is that I can't see how Depp's lawyers would have agreed to include that line if he hadn't been in some way physically violent).

Anyway, the point is that it's complicated. Depp should absolutely be assumed innocent unless it's proven otherwise, but just because it hasn't been proven does not mean that Heard is lying.  I hate that the #metoo movement has led to assumption of guilt when these accusations are made, but I equally hate how possible victims become demonised when there's even the slightest suggestion that their claims can't be proven.

For all we know Amber could be the sweetest person right now and hasn't done anything bad since and is trying to be a better person, but people keep bringing this shit up and make her out to be this big bad villain who won't change. People can be complex. I believe people can change and learn from their mistakes (sometimes it doesn't always happen and people slip back into their old ways, but there is also examples of people changing for the better), so I'm not going to judge Amber on something she may or may not have done a couple of years ago. She is probably deeply sorry for what she did, if she did it. Like I said I don't know her or Depp personally. Maybe both of them were at it and it was a toxic relationship that was never going to work. We don't know the full facts and what went on behind closed doors. Anyway I couldn't give a fuck regardless, as there is probably only like 10 mainstream actors in Hollywood that don't have skeletons in their closest, and I don't think an actors personal life should affect their acting ability (unless they are Kevin Spacey and rape kids, then I draw the line as it's fucking sick and immoral).",t3_a6fqbi,r/Aquaman,BryanDowling93,2018-12-15 17:02:28,Negative,Neutral,7.0,submission,comment,229,proof_that_amber_heard_is_an_abuser_and_jd_is,10,[],0

It's in very poor taste that for appearance purposes she released the joint statement that the marriage was loving and passionate then comes out that he's abusive. Something there is a lie and she hasn't substantiated the claims of abuse (at least I didn't see any evidence in the article). Claiming that it's the patriarchy that's blocking you after making such a stupid statement is, in itself, just as stupid. For all I know they divorced because he couldn't be with someone that couldn't tell the difference between a Zimbabwe dollar and an American dollar. The point being that she says one thing and then slander him with no proof. Who the fuck wants to pay to hire her for the drama. You can hire another actress that doesn't come with that kind of baggage and stupidity. It's not that they're protecting men it's that they're protecting their money. You don't want her getting the lead male in a movie arrested mid-shoot. 

Regarding the threats they go both ways. I'm sure he's getting them too from her fans but she just assumes it's the patriarchy and only women get death threats. 

The other thing that bugs me is she's awarded $7M as a 32 year old professional when he's closer to the standard retirement age at 55 years old. Then she goes and donates part of that 7M she took.

I just wish I could see his face when he saw that announcement. ""That bitch and her lawyer took me for 7M and argued she needed it to survive then gives the money away"". 

You can't make this stuff up.

Edit: I think this article tells the time line and story a bit better
https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/16/amber-heard-assault-allegations-johnny-depp-divorce

The question remains basically whether she and her friend lied to get more money or if her claims are true. We've seen videos of women on this sub hitting themselves with hammers so they can go to the cops. Of course the home is a private place where witnesses of abuse happening live is nearly impossible. Either way it seems he resolved it by paying her off whether it was true or not. Anecdotally my aunt is a gold digger who married for money. He paid her off and she still came back to try and get more. The divorce was also 100% her own fault which I hate to say about my own family.",t3_a7lypo,r/MensRights,DownvotedByShitters,2018-12-19 13:15:12,Positive,Neutral,413.0,submission,comment,416,amber_heard_received_death_threats_and_was,7,['https://www.theguardian.com'],1

I know about their joint statement of the relationship being ""passionate and at times volatile, but always driven by love"", but aside from him denying that he's ever abused her, that's all I can find.

Was it ever confirmed whether or not Depp abused her at all, verbally or physically?

**Edit**: I am not saying that I think it's up to Depp to prove to anyone that he did not abuse Heard. OP claims that Heard's allegations are false. I am asking if there is hard evidence anywhere that her allegations are, in fact, false, or if is there is any proof that her allegations are, without question, true. 

/u/j3utton is correct: If there is no evidence proving that the allegations are either *undoubtedly true* or *undoubtedly false*, one cannot make the claim that ""Heard has falsely accused Depp of abusing her"" , nor can they claim that ""Depp has abused Heard"".

No. It doesn't. That's the point. Making false allegations is itself a crime. If you're going to accuse someone of that, you need to prove it, because guess what, they're innocent until proven guilty as well.

Absent evidence we as third parties can't know what actually happened. All we can ask is ""is there enough evidence to prove his guilt?"". If there isn't then we assume he's innocent.

There are two separate issues being discussed here. You want to focus on the burden of proof of proving the allegations true. That's not what I'm discussing. I'm discussing the burden of proof of proving the allegations false. They are not the same thing yet you seem to be falsely conflating the two. This is where reading comprehension would come in handy.

To the first issue - no one, including myself, is claiming the accused needs to prove they are innocent by proving the allegations against them are false. They are presumed innocent until proven guilty. The burden of proof is on the accuser. However, if the burden of proof is not met, that does not necessarily mean the allegations are false, it just means they couldn't be proven true.

Now, on to the second point, which is the point I've been trying to discuss. Making a false allegation is itself a crime. If you're going to accuse someone of making a false allegation you need to prove the allegation they made is false, because the person you are accusing is also innocent until proven guilty.

By this login Kavenaugh should not have been confirmed, as the possibility that he might be innocent is thrown out the window, with prejudice.

Since the man cannot accuse a woman of making a false rape accusation (as it is not even against the law), what burden of proof do you assert he bears?

> Making a false allegation is itself a crime. 

It is not a crime against the man accused, even if he spends 20 years in prison, he has no legal standing to raise a criminal case against the women. Only the prosecutor can, and that as a crime against the state.

> If you're going to accuse someone of making a false allegation you need to prove the allegation they made is false

Victims of false rape accusations have no standing to make a criminal accusation against the woman. 

> because the person you are accusing is also innocent until proven guilty.

Even women who are tried for *perjury* (US) or *'wasting police time'* or *'perverting the course of justice'* (UK) usually get suspended sentences at worse. Both the US and UK governments would rather put innocent men in prison than guilty women, so they almost never try women, even when their is clear evidence that they were not raped.

* Judge Joseph Sheeran, who also ordered the woman receive a mental health assessment, did not give Zolwolski credit for previous time served.
